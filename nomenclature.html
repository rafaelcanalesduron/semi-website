    		    <p>Natural-language processing (<abbr>NLP</abbr>) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language data.<br>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing">read more</a>]</p>

    		    <p>Decentralized [networking] is the allocation of resources, both hardware and software, to each individual workstation, or office location. In contrast, centralized computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out, or obtained from a remote centralized location. Decentralized computing is a trend in modern-day business environments. This is the opposite of centralized computing, which was prevalent during the early days of computers.<br>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing">read more</a>]</p>
