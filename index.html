    	<h2>Can you make sense of your data?</h2>
		<p>Let’s admit it&#8201;–&#8201;If your company is like most, you are having difficulty gaining information and insights from your data. At SeMI, we believe <a href="nomenclature.html#nlp">natural language processing</a> can give meaning and context to your data.</p>
		<p>SeMI is a decentralized network, where members can exchange knowledge based on the insights hidden in their metadata. As a member you can receive customized and real time insights. To magnify the value you can build your own application on top of SeMI.</p>

            	<p>SeMI uses natural language processing (<abbr>NLP</abbr>) to help you make sense of your data in a way that makes sense to you. <abbr>NLP</abbr> focuses on the interactions between human language and computers.</p>

            	<p>The power of SeMI is its ability to connect multiple systems and sources of information without a common information structure. Different systems and sources independent from each other. Everyone’s data is secure.</p>
