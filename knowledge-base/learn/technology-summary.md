## Problem

Is your company spending a lot of money acquiring, processing and analysing large sets of data, yet is not able to generate insights needed to drive business decisions? You are not alone! According to a Bain & Company survey, 59% of companies struggle to generate meaningful business insights from their data. Annually, $ 18,9 billion is spent on unnecessarily aggregated market insights. 

## SeMI - Semantic Machine Insights

SeMI allows you to tackle the data problem by taking a radically different approach from current solutions such as data lakes: the power of SeMI lies in the ability to connect multiple systems and sources of information **without the need for a common structuration** of the information. Different systems and sources do not need to know about each other’s dataset and the way that the information is stored. 

SeMI is a decentralized semantic knowledge network that enables cross-company data collaboration without sharing system-of-record data. Our product offering enables you to enrich your market and customer understanding through the exchange of valuable insights generated by the entire network

SeMI focuses on hyper-organized information, also known as "Knowledge graphs". SeMI enables companies to refine their data into knowledge graphs stored in [Weaviate](http://dev.semi.network/knowledge-base/INSERT_LINK.html): a decentralised Semantic Knowledge Graph that is at the heart of SeMI. 

## Start with the business questions

SeMI starts from the business perspective: which business decisions need data-driven insights? What are the key questions you want answers to? We help you discover and develop your key business questions in our [exploration workshop](http://dev.semi.network/knowledge-base/INSERT_LINK.html). In this workshop we introduce you to SeMI and develop your custom use cases.

## Your data is safe

You stay in complete control of your own information: raw data is never shared! SeMI focuses on the things that the raw data portrays and links that information together to create a graph of knowledge that can be consulted by consumers of the network.

SeMI is decentralized, which means there is no central platform. SeMI runs on your own servers or in your own cloud. For more information on this topic, please refer to our [legal brief](http://dev.semi.network/knowledge-base/INSERT_LINK.html).
