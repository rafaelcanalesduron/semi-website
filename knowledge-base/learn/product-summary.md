## SeMI products

SeMI offers two propositions: **SeMI Local** and **SeMI World**. The key difference between the SeMI products is the size of the network of information sources that you can explore to enrich your insights. Combining multiple sources using SeMI exponentially enhances the quality of your knowledge gained.

Each information source is stored in a *SeMI Node* and can be queried by other nodes in the network. Each node can offer additional information to a query from the network. The more nodes in the network, the richer the answer to the query.

The power of SeMI is that these nodes to not need a common structuration of the information. Different systems and sources do not need to know about each other’s dataset and the way that the information is stored.

- With **SeMI Local** you can generate meaningful market insights based on your own company’s data. *SeMI Local* allows you to uncover hidden connections between different sources of information within your company. These can be sources that you generate yourself, for example your own CRM data, or data sources that you have acquired from third parties. 

- In **SeMI World** we not only connect your own sources of information, but we also connect you to other members of the network. Furthermore, we connect you to (potentially multiple) SeMI netwerk(s) that are relevant specifically for your use cases and your industry.  

Independent of the SeMI product, we support you fully in deploying SeMI and getting your use cases up and running. We support you to:

1. Discover and develop your key business questions in our exploration workshop.
2. Identify and collect data sources for your use cases.
3. Refine your data from each source that you want to exploit in your network.
4. Deploy your use case on your favourite system or cloud service.
